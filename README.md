# product-ui

This project contains a Vue SPA that uses an API from the product-api project to manage a collection of Products. This was developed in a few hours using ChatGPT, by a polyglot software engineer that knew Javascript and had completed half of a VueJS developers course. See [here](https://chat.openai.com/share/5d5db6f2-2f42-491a-9673-3246feb20013) for the chat conversation.
